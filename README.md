# Cluster Validation Suite
CVS is a collection of tests scripts that can validate AMD AI clusters end to end from running single node burn in health tests to cluster wide distributed training and inferencing tests. CVS can be used by AMD customers to verify the health of the cluster as a whole which includes verifying the GPU/CPU node health, Host OS configuratin checks, NIC validations etc. CVS test suite collection comprises of the following set of tests

1. Platform Tests - Host OS config checks, BIOS checks, Firmware/Driver checks, Network config checks.
2. Burn in Health Tests - AGFHC, Transferbench, RocBLAS, rocHPL, Single node RCCL
3. Network Tests - Ping checks, Multi node RCCL validations for different collectives
4. Distributed Training Tests - Run Llama 70B and 405B model distributed trainings with JAX and Megatron frameworks.
5. Distributed Inferencing Tests - Work in Progress

CVS leverages the PyTest open source framework to run the tests and generate reports and can be launched from a head-node or any linux management station which has connectivity to the cluster nodes via SSH. The single node tests are run in parallel cluster wide using the parallel-ssh open source python modules to optimize the time for running them. Currently CVS has been validated only on Ubuntu based Linux distro clusters. 

CVS Repository is organized as the following directories

1. tests directory - This comprises of the actual pytest scripts that would be run which internally will be calling the library functions under the ./lib directory which are in native python and can be invoked from any python scripts for reusability. The tests directory has sub folder based on the nature of the tests like health, rccl, training etc.
2. lib directory - This is a collection of python modules which offer a wide range of utility functions and can be reused in other python scripts as well.
3. input directory - This is a collection of the input json files that are provided to the pytest scripts using the 2 arguments --cluster_file and the --config_file. The cluster_file is a JSON file which captures all the aspects of the cluster testbed, things like the IP address/hostnames, username, keyfile etc. We avoid putting a lot of other information like linux net devices names or rdma device names etc to keep it user friendly and auto-discover them.
4. utils directory - This is a collection of standalone scripts which can be run natively without pytest and offer different utility functions.

# How to install

It is recommended to run CVS from a runner machine - Ubuntu VM or bare metal and in the absence of a dedicated runner machine, you can also install and run it from the first host in your cluster. It is recommended to run from a dedicated runner machine as if we hit some catastrophic failure like some uncorrectable errors during a burn-in health test which results in host reboot, the test will be abruptly aborted and you will loose the test report.

# Setting up your environment for CVS

Enter your venv environment and from there install the required python packages using the following commands

```
abc@123~:$
abc@123~:$source myenv/bin/activate
(myenv) abc@123~:$
(myenv) abc@123~:$cd cvs
(myenv) abc@123~/cvs:(main)$ls -l requirements.txt 
-rw-rw-r-- 1 abc abc 181 Aug 26 17:16 requirements.txt
(myenv) abc@123~/cvs:(main)$
(myenv) abc@123~/cvs:(main)$pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# How to run CVS Tests

All the Pytest scripts from cvs/tests folder must be run from the cvs root folder as shown below as the system lib paths have been set accordingly. 

```
abc@123# 
abc@123# pwd
/home/user/cvs
abc@123# pytest -vvv -log-file=/tmp/rccl_test.log -s ./tests/rccl/rccl_multinode_cvs.py --cluster_file ./input/mi325_cluster.json --config_file ./input/rccl/rccl_config.json --html=/var/www/html/cvs/rccl_test_report.html --capture=tee-sys --self-contained-html
```

The arguments used are

```
-log-file                 - The text log file where all the python logger outputs are captured
-s                        - This is the script that will be executed by Pytest
--cluster_file            - Location of the cluster file which has the details of the cluster - IPs, access details
--config_file             - This is the configuration file used for the test. Depending on the test suite that is being run, the configuration will vary like the rccl test in the above case uses the rccl_config.json file which captures all relevant information related to RCCL like the environment variables, configuration options etc. The sample input files are organized as sub-directories under the cvs/input folder in similar fashion as the pytests
--html                    - This is the output HTML report file that will be generated by Pytest at the end of the script completion. It will have a summary of the number of test cases that have passed/failed etc and one can also navigate the logs directly in the browser from this report
--capture=tee-sys         - capture all std.out and std.err writes from your tests
--self-contained-html     - Generate as a single HTML report including the styling and embedded images for all test cases
```

You can also create a wrapper shell script to run multiple test suites one after the other by putting the different pytest run commands in a bash script as described in the README under the cvs/tests/health folder.

FOR MORE DETAILS on running individual test suites and details on the configuration files, please refer the individual folder README.md files.
