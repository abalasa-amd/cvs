What is Cluster Validation Suite (CVS)?
=======================================

CVS is a collection of test scripts that validate AMD AI clusters. 
Use CVS to verify cluster health, GPU/CPU node health, host OS configuration checks, and NIC (network interface card) validations.

Here are the tests available in the CVS:

-	**Platform tests**: Perform host OS configuration, BIOS, firmware/driver, and network configuration checks.
-	**Burn-in health tests**: Perform AMD GPU Field Health Check (AGFHC), TransferBench, rocBLAS, and Babelstream tests.
-	**Network tests**: Perform ping checks and multi-node ROCm Communication Collectives Library (RCCL) validations for different collectives.
- **InfiniBand (IB Perf)**: These tests are low-level network performance benchmarks that validate the raw communication capabilities of InfiniBand adapters and interconnects. These tests measure the fundamental building blocks that RCCL and other high-level libraries depend on.

CVS uses the PyTest open-source framework to run the tests and generate reports. You can launch CVS from a head node or any Linux management station that has connectivity to the cluster nodes via SSH. 
The single node tests run cluster-wide in parallel using the open-source parallel-SSH Python modules to optimize their running time.  

.. note::

   CVS has only been validated on Ubuntu-based Linux distribution clusters.
