# CVS Extension Configuration File (extension.ini)
# 
# This file allows extension packages to configure how they extend the core CVS package.
# 
# USAGE PATTERNS:
# 
# Pattern 1: Extension package wraps CVS as a submodule
#   - Place this file at the root of your extension package
#   - During your extension's setup.py installation, copy extension.ini into the cvs package
#     Example: shutil.copy("extension.ini", "cvs/cvs/extension.ini")
#   - This allows cvs to auto-discover extension configuration during runtime
#   - CVS will look for extension.ini in site-packages/cvs/extension.ini
#
# Pattern 2: Standalone extension package(s)
#   - Set CVS_EXTENSION_PKG_NAMES environment variable to your extension package name(s)
#     Example: export CVS_EXTENSION_PKG_NAMES=my_cvs_extension
#     Example: export CVS_EXTENSION_PKG_NAMES=ext1,ext2,ext3
#   - CVS will look for extension.ini in each package in order (comma-separated list)
#   - If CVS_EXTENSION_PKG_NAMES is not set, CVS looks in site-packages/cvs/extension.ini
#   - Useful when you don't bundle cvs as a submodule
#
# CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
# - package_name: Name of the extension package (shown alongside cvs in version output)
# - tests_dirs: Comma-separated paths to test directories (relative to site-packages root)
# - input_dirs: Comma-separated paths to input/config directories (relative to site-packages root)

[extensions]

# Override the package name reported by 'cvs --version'
# When set, the extension package version will be displayed alongside the cvs version.
# Example: cvs --version will output:
#   cvs: 1.0.0
#   cvs_extension: 1.0.0
package_name = cvs_extension

# Comma-separated list of test directories to include in test discovery
# Paths are relative to site-packages root.
# CVS will automatically discover and include tests from these directories
# in addition to the core cvs/tests directory.
# Multiple directories can be specified by separating them with commas.
#
# IMPORTANT: For Pattern 1 (submodule wrapper), use relative paths from site-packages:
#   tests_dirs = cvs_extension/tests
# This resolves to: <site-packages>/cvs_extension/tests
#
# Example with multiple directories:
#   tests_dirs = cvs_extension/tests1,cvs_extension/tests2
tests_dirs = cvs_extension/tests

# Comma-separated list of input/config directories for 'cvs copy-config'
# Paths are relative to site-packages root.
# The copy-config plugin will search for config files in:
#   - input_dir/config_file/
#   - input_dir/cluster_file/
#   - input_dir/ (if it contains json files)
# This allows extensions to provide additional configuration files alongside
# the core CVS configuration files.
#
# IMPORTANT: For Pattern 1 (submodule wrapper), use relative paths from site-packages:
#   input_dirs = cvs_extension/input
# This resolves to: <site-packages>/cvs_extension/input
#
# Example with multiple directories:
#   input_dirs = cvs_extension/input1,cvs_extension/input2
input_dirs = cvs_extension/input1,cvs_extension/input2

# Example with multiple directories:
#   input_dirs = cvs_extension/input,other_extension/configs
input_dirs = cvs_extension/input
